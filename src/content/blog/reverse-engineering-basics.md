  "Decipher the inner workings of compiled programs through Reverse Engineering. Transform machine code back into a human-readable format, understanding program functionality and identifying vulnerabilities. While the challenges may involve analyzing assembly code, this skill is invaluable for those interested in malware analysis or game hacking."

# Reverse Engineering

Reverse Engineering in a CTF is typically the process of taking a compiled (machine code, bytecode) program and converting it back into a more human readable format.

Very often the goal of a reverse engineering challenge is to understand the functionality of a given program such that you can identify deeper issues.

While our challenges dont use it, most reverse engineering challenges in the future requires you to analyze assembly code which can be decompiled to C program. Why assembly? because its the lowest level human readable computer language. But this should not scare you. If you want to get into malware analysis or game hacking, knowing such things is pretty much compulsory so deal with it.

I cant really say more about reverse engineering since thats pretty much it so.... moving on.
